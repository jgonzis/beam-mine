Open Source Beam Pool Software w/ Guide

By installing the pool software and BASiC Payment processor from this guide, you fully agree to this following disclaimer:

DISCLAIMER: This Beam open source pool software comes with no warranty and it is the sole responsibility of the user to ensure the functions and design of their own deployment, meet the required standards which a cryptocurrency miner would expect to see in a mining pool. Where the code is complete in-as-much as the pool stratum, API and a barebones deployment of the GUI is functional and working, it is also the responsibility of the user to ensure that they have adept knowledge in pool systems. This code is offered freely under MIT licencing and the authors, host and publishers will hold no responsibility, nor support for installation or troubleshooting.

The pool software is also now offered with Beam’s BASiC rewards distribution function and this part is contained in accompanying repository, with it’s own README file and same disclaimer above applies.

A testing pool built from this software can be found at https://pool.raskul.com/ – so, you can see what you will get by navigating to this link.

All OK with that? then read on…

To begin compiling the Beam open source pool software, you will need to find a suitable VPS (Virtual Private Server) from a respectable hosting company. On the BEAM ACCEPTED HERE pages you can find a few who accept Beam for their services.

Once you have found a VPS, please log in and you can start to set up the pool.

Firstly update your server.

	sudo apt update

	sudo apt upgrade
Next, install the required dependencies to build and run the pool

	sudo apt install python-dev build-essential libsodium-dev npm libboost-all-dev libboost-dev
You will also need to install NODEJS 10.x and MYSQL, separately from the above dependencies

	sudo apt install curl

	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -

	sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

	sudo apt install -y mysql-server
Update & Upgrade again just to make sure all these are current releases.

	sudo apt-get update

	sudo apt-get upgrade
Next, install REDIS SERVER

	sudo apt-get install redis-server
and enable the REDIS service

	sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service
This will then require a server reboot…

	sudo reboot now
Once reboot is complete, log into your server again as root and install php-redis

	sudo apt-get install php-redis
You are now ready to clone the repository which holds all the pool code!

	git clone https://github.com/r45ku1/beam-mine.git
Go into the beam-pool folder and make sure it’s up to date.

	cd beam-mine

	npm update

	npm install
Now you need to configure your MYSQL Db’s

	cd /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/

	nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
and edit the line as shown:

	bind-address            = 0.0.0.0
save the file.

You will now want to build the Beam node and Wallet which will link to the pool stratum, and amend your config files.

	cd

	mkdir beam-node

	cd beam-node

	wget https://beam.mw/downloads/mainnet-linux (and use the node link )

	tar -xvf beam-node-VERSION.tar.gz

	wget https://beam.mw/downloads/mainnet-linux (and use the wallet link )

	tar -xvf beam-wallet-VERSION.tar.gz
Make a subfolder named stratum_secrets

	mkdir stratum_secrets

	cd stratum_secrets
You will need to now generate a set of ssl key/certificate for your pool, to do this run the following command

 

	openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout beam-stratum-key.pem -out beam-stratum-crt.pem -days 3650 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost’
Now rename the two files created in this process using.

	mv beam-stratum-key.pem stratum.key
	mv beam-stratum-crt.pem stratum.crt
You will now have one file stratum.key and one file stratum.crt in this folder. Go back up a level

	cd ..
Next step will be to choose a password for the wallet and add it to your beam-wallet.cfg file. Open the beam-wallet.cfg file using a text editor

	nano beam-wallet.cfg
and put your password at the command line:

	pass=YOURPASSWORD
Uncomment the line by removing the single # sign.

Also amend there:

	node_addr=127.0.0.1:10127
Again, uncomment this line by removing the single # sign.Those are the only 2 configurations that must be done on beam-wallet.cfg Save the file and close it.

You can now initiate your Beam Pool wallet

	./beam-wallet init
Save the output info in a safe place. This is your seed phrase and wallet default address, into which all mined coins from the pool, will be stored prior to distribution to your miners

You will also want to set that default address to never expire

	./beam-wallet change_address_expiration --address=YOURDEFAULTWALLETADDRESS --expiration_time=never
Next you will need two keys to configure them the node. Please run the following command

	./beam-wallet export_miner_key --subkey=1

	./beam-wallet export_owner_key
Take the keys and put in the beam-node.cfg on the lines

	owner_key=
&

	miner_key=
Uncomment the line by removing the single # signs on each line. Now edit #password for keys in beam-node.cfg so that it matches #password for the wallet in beam-wallet.cfg – this is the password that you created previously.

	pass=YOURPASSWORD
Whilst still within a text editor in beam-node.cfg, locate each of the below lines and amend;

	port=10127
	log_level=verbose
	file_log_level=verbose
	peer=node01.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,eu-node02.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,eu-node03.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,eu-node04.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,us-node01.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,us-node02.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,us-node03.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,us-node04.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,ap-node01.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,ap-node02.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,ap-node03.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,ap-node04.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,ap-hk-node01.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,ap-hk-node02.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,ap-hk-node03.mainnet.beam.mw:8100,ap-hk-node04.mainnet.beam.mw:8100
	peers_persistent=1
	stratum_port=3333
	stratum_secrets_path=./stratum_secrets/
Open a new command line window which you are prepared to leave open (or screen -dmS it) all the time – this command window will contain the perpetual node connection. It is imperative that this process is never stopped. Navigate into your beam-node folder and start the node by typing;

	./beam-node
Whilst allowing the node to synchronise and depending on your device firewall settings, you may need to “allow” it to open all the ports required to run the pool. Have a separate terminal window open for extra commands (these are all the hard-coded ports which the pool will utilise)

	sudo ufw allow 10127

	sudo ufw allow 8010

	sudo ufw allow 80

	sudo ufw allow 1690

	sudo ufw allow 3333

	sudo ufw allow 6379

	sudo ufw allow 6543

	sudo ufw allow 3306

	sudo ufw allow 666
Let the node synchronise with the network by downloading the Beam blockchain. This may take a while, depending on your connection speed. Once fully synchronised, you will see your Beam node collect the most up to date block height. Compare the node height with https://explorer.beam.mw/ and ensure it matches before continuing. The % will also show 100% in the node printout.

Once the node is fully synchronised, use a command line window which you are prepared to leave open all the time (or screen -dmS it). Navigate within the command line to your beam-node folder and type:

	./beam-wallet listen
This enables the Beam pool wallet to perpetually listen at the Beam node. Now let’s move onto your MYSQL database setup. Use an third-party software (such as sequelpro) to manage your schema tables. You will also need to create a MYSQL USER outside of ROOT to manage your Beam database (which we will create as follows…)

	mysql -u root

	CREATE USER 'newMYSQLuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'MYSQLpassword';
	
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newMYSQLuser'@'localhost';

	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
And confirm your new user has privileges

	SHOW GRANTS FOR 'database_user'@'localhost';
Now in your MYSQL third party software (sequelpro or similar) create your tables within a new database ‘beam’

	CREATE DATABASE beam
	USE beam
	
	CREATE TABLE `accounts` (
	  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `coinid` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `username` varchar(96) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `ip` varchar(96) DEFAULT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=3 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

	CREATE TABLE `blocks` (
	  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `coinid` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,

	  `jobid` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=202 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

	CREATE TABLE `shares` (
	  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `coinid` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `userid` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `blockhash` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `height` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `difficulty` double DEFAULT NULL,
	  `sharediff` double DEFAULT NULL,
	  `workerid` int(96) DEFAULT NULL,
	 `time` int(18) DEFAULT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=2000 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

	CREATE TABLE `workers` (
	  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `userid` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `ip` varchar(96) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `name` varchar(96) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `difficulty` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
	  `rigname` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
	 `time` int(18) DEFAULT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=28 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
EDIT YOUR CONFIGURATION FILES
